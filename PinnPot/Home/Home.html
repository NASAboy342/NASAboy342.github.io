        <H1>Hi, I'm Sopheaktra or you can just call me Pin</H1>
        <p>I'm a junior C# developer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications. I have experience in developing web, desktop, and mobile applications using C#, ASP.NET, Xamarin, and SQL Server. 
    
            Some of the projects that I have worked on include:
            
            - A web application that allows users to create and share custom quizzes online, using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and Bootstrap.
            - A desktop application that simulates a virtual piano, using C#, WPF, and MIDI libraries.
            - A mobile application that helps users track their expenses and budget, using Xamarin.Forms, SQLite, and Azure.
            
            I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I'm currently interested in exploring the fields of machine learning, cloud computing, and game development.
